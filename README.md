# Berkeley AUTOLAB's Memory Package

## Overview
Dex-Net memory system.

## TODOs (in order of priority)
- [x] Test inference. (vsatish)
- [x] Add support for featurization. Important for training time & network size constraints. (vsatish)
- [x] Add support for analysis. (vsatish + ksanders)
- [x] Begin hyper-parameter search. (ksanders)
- [x] Add suport for more layer features such as BatchNorm, Pooling, Regularization, etc. (vsatish)
- [ ] Add support for data augmentation. (vsatish)
- [ ] Add support for Triplet Network. (vsatish)
- [ ] Experiment with cropped inputs. (vsatish + ksanders)
- [x] Add nearest neighbors. (ksanders)
- [ ] Add support for hyper-parameter search. (vsatish)
